## Objective

I am seeking an Engineering Manager role on a strong team, where I can leverage
my skills to drive meaningful impact. While I aim to manage and lead, I prefer
to remain close to the technology and contribute hands-on when needed. I am also
open to an individual contributor role if it aligns with my expertise and goals.

## Skills

I have worked in technology leadership roles (Lead Developer, startup CTO) for
most of my career, but I have always been a polyglot developer at heart. Most
recently, I've been working with pretty typical modern web stacks, primarily
consisting of Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Tanstack Query with Python
powering FastAPI or Flask backends.  Mostly deployed on AWS via CDK.

The vast majority of my professional career has been spent doing some sort of
web based development in various environments (C, Java, ASP, ASP.NET,
Ruby/Rails, Python/Django, Clojure/ClojureScript, Erlang, Elm and Haskell) but I
am comfortable with a number of other languages and enviroments as well.

I have strong SQL and database skills. PostgreSQL and Redis are my favorite SQL
and NoSQL datastores, respectively, but I am experienced and comfortable with
many others.
