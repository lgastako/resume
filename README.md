## Objective

Be part of a strong team that is building something interesting and useful
where my skills can add significant value.

## Skills

I have worked in technology leadership roles (Lead Developer, CTO, etc) for
most of my career, but I have always been a polyglot developer at heart.  The
vast majority of my professional career has been spent doing some sort of web
based development in various environments (C, Java, ASP, ASP.NET, Ruby/Rails,
Python/Django, Clojure/ClojureScript and Haskell) but I am comfortable with
other languages and enviroments as well. I have strong SQL and database skills.
PostgreSQL and Redis are my favorite SQL and NoSQL datastores respectively, but
I am experienced and comfortable with many others.
