## Objective

Motivated and innovative software engineer with over a decade of experience
in leading engineering teams, designing cutting-edge tools, and fostering
collaboration across departments. Seeking to leverage extensive background
in tool development, AI integrations, and team leadership to contribute to
the Engineering Acceleration team at OpenAI.

Enthusiastic software engineer with a passion for developing innovative AI
solutions and a proven track record in leading engineering teams. Eager

## Skills

I have worked in technology leadership roles (Lead Developer, CTO, etc) for
most of my career, but I have always been a polyglot developer at heart.  The
vast majority of my professional career has been spent doing some sort of web
based development in various environments (C, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript,
Ruby/Rails, Python/Django, Clojure/ClojureScript and Elm/Haskell) but I am
comfortable with other languages and enviroments as well. I have strong SQL
and database skills. PostgreSQL and Redis are my favorite SQL and NoSQL
datastores respectively, but I am experienced and comfortable with many
others too.
