## Objective

Contribute to something meaningful while I plan the next phase of my life.

## Skills

I have worked in technology leadership roles (Lead Developer, CTO, etc) for
most of my career, but I have always been a polyglot developer at heart.  The
vast majority of my professional career has been spent doing some sort of web
based development in various environments (Java, ASP, ASP.NET, Ruby/Rails,
Python/Django, Clojure/ClojureScript) but I am comfortable with other languages
and enviroments as well. I have strong SQL and database skills.  PostgreSQL and
Redis are my favorite SQL and NoSQL datastores respectively, but I am
experienced and comfortable with many others.
